    <center><h1>Natasha Romanoff</h1></center>
    <p>Natalia Alianovna Romanoff, more commonly known as Natasha Romanoff, is a fictional character primarily portrayed by Scarlett Johansson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—sometimes known by her alias, Black Widow. Romanoff is depicted as an expert spy and hand-to-hand combatant, trained in the Red Room from childhood to be a KGB assassin. This brought her under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar, and Clint Barton was sent to kill her but instead spared her life and recruited her into the organization.

        When Nick Fury activates the Avengers Initiative, she becomes a founding member. Following the fallout related to the Sokovia Accords, Romanoff became a fugitive and eventually reunited with her adopted family, including sister Yelena Belova. They worked together to destroy General Dreykov's Black Widow program. After Thanos erases half of all life, Romanoff leads the Avengers for five years until she sacrifices herself to obtain the Soul Stone, successfully helping the Avengers restore trillions of lives across the universe.</p>
    <h>Early life</h>
    <p>Natalia Alianovna Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Альяновна Романова) was born on December 3, 1984, in the Soviet Union, and was trained as a KGB spy in a secretive academy called the Red Room which involved training as a ballerina as a cover,[7] as well as the eventual sterilization of the students.[8] She grew up in a false family with Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff as her 'parents' and Yelena Belova as her younger 'sister'.[9] In 1995, when Shostakov completes his assigned mission to steal intel from S.H.I.E.L.D. in Ohio, the family escape to Cuba where they rendezvous with their boss, General Dreykov, who has Romanoff and Belova put through the Red Room for further training to become assassins.

        Eventually, Clint Barton is sent to kill Romanoff, but instead chooses to spare her life and recruit her to S.H.I.E.L.D., enabling Romanoff to defect from the USSR and escape her previous life.[b] In Budapest, with Barton's help, Romanoff rigs a bomb in an attempt to kill Dreykov, seemingly killing his daughter Antonia in the process.</p>
